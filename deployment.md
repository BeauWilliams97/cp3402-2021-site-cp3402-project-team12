Development & Deployment Workflow

1. First fork the repository & clone said fork to a local directory | Pull any changes that have been made to the main branch into your fork.
   
2. Once you have committed and pushed something to the fork that you can then make a pull request

3. The pull request is then reviewed and can be merged in to the main branch

4. At this stage we manually take the theme and import it into the staging server and complete requisite testing

5. If the theme works properly then we import it into the live server
